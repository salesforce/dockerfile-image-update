# This workflow will triage pull requests and apply a label based on the
# paths that are modified in the pull request.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to set up a .github/labeler.yml
# file with configuration.  For more information, see:
# https://github.com/actions/labeler/blob/main/README.md
#
# Runs on `pull_request_target` to get a write token. This is safe since we're not checking
# out any arbitrary git repos.
